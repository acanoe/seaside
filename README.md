# Seaside

_Where the sea meets the land_

## Intro

This repository contains all the source for my journey in learning Docker. It has all the materials to build my own image. I also list all the tips and tricks i found while learning it and the best practices I should do.

## How to run

Most of the subfolder should have README.md you can read to understand what the folder is for, and how to run the image.
